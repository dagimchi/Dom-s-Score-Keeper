# Dom-s-Score-Keeper
From Colt's 2022 Udemy Course. First attempt, no peeking.

## The Challenge

User should be able to interact with the 3 buttons to tally up a 
game of ping pong. The app should keep score between 2 players
where a round is played until the value set by the user is met.
Upon reaching the set value the player buttons should be disabled,
and the player scores should change color. Green for victory, red
for defeat. And lastly, the reset button should work as intended.
